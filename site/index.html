  <h1 class="notoc noanchor">Oatcake: <span class="not-below-24-em">plain</span> web typography</h1>
  <p class="lead">A drop-in stylesheet that makes any HTML page's text
  attractive and readable, no CSS classes needed.
  Looks good without drawing attention to the design,
  lots of typographic features and details,
  everything works great on mobile.</p>
</hgroup>

<p>This page is a demo of Oatcake, my universal typography stylesheet. To add
Oatcake to your own page just add this link to your HTML file's
<code>&lt;head&gt;</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://www.seanh.cc/oatcake/oatcake.css"&gt;</code></pre>

<p>You don't need any CSS classes or any particular HTML structure: Oatcake
styles the standard HTML elements directly. You can use it to style HTML
straight from <dfn><a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown.</a></dfn></p>

<p>For more documentation and examples see <a href="https://github.com/seanh/oatcake">Oatcake's README on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>There are loads of these typography stylesheets out there but I couldn't
find one that was a great fit for my tastes and the type of content that I
write, or that handled all the minutiae and edge-cases that I care about
without issues.</p>

<p>Oatcake has lots of typographic features including a system font stack,
vertical rhythm, figures and captions, blockquotes, note boxes, disclosure
widgets, badges and pills, multiple levels of headings, subtitles and lead
paragraphs, <code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;samp&gt;</code> styles, and
more.</p>

<p>My pages tend to have a wide variety of content and different combinations
of HTML elements. Oatcake carefully handles many situations that break most
themes: things like nested lists, definition lists, multi-paragraph
blockquotes, multi-line headings, headings with code and links in them,
headings inside blockquotes, wrapping long words and wide code blocks, images
and other media, etc.</p>

<p>The rest of this page demonstrates and discusses Oatcake's features and
design decisions. Plus I needed a comprehensive test page.
You may even learn something about HTML along the way!

<style>.toc a { text-decoration: none; }</style>
<div class="toc"></div>

<p>The table of contents is generated by <a href="https://tscanlin.github.io/tocbot/">Tocbot</a>.
If you hover the mouse over headings on this page they have clickable
<code>#anchor</code> links, those are generated by
<a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/anchorjs/">AnchorJS</a>.</p>

<h2>System font stack</h2>

<p>Oatcake uses a <a href="https://modernfontstacks.com/">system font stack</a>
based on the <code>system-ui</code> font-family: it chooses the default
interface font from the user's OS. This is fast (no fonts to download),
readable (modern OSes ship high-quality fonts adapted to today's screens), and
feels familiar and native to the user's system (no distracting idiosyncratic
font choices).</p>

<p>Code blocks use a system monospaced font stack based on the
<code>ui-monospace</code> font-family which selects the OS's default monospaced
font.</p>

<h2>Vertical rhythm</h2>

<p>Oatcake sets a comfortable base font-size and line-height and aligns all the
other sizes, margins, paddings and borders with that vertical rhythm, like
writing on a sheet of lined paper. This makes everything harmonious and
pleasant to read. You can turn on guide lines to see what I mean:</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><button class="pill" onclick="toggleLines();">Toggle Lines</button></p>

<h2>Inline elements</h2>

<p>
All the usual inline elements work nicely, for example:
<a href="http://example.com/">links</a>,
<code>code()</code>,
<em>emphasised words</em>,
<strong>words in bold</strong>,
<del>struck through text</del>,
<u>underlined text</u>,
<mark>highlighted text</mark>,
mid-word emphasis: un<em>frigging</em>believable, un<strong>frigging</strong>believable,
<small>small text</small>,
subscripts<sub>sub</sub> and superscripts<sup>sup</sup>,
and abbreviations like <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>.
</p>

<p>Mixing different inline elements together works too, for example
here's <a href="http://example.com/" title="Title">a link with <strong>bold</strong> and <code>code()</code> in it</a>,
an <a href="http://example.com/" title="Title"><strong>all bold link</strong></a>,
and an <a href="http://example.com/" title="Title"><code>all_code_link()</code></a>.
</p>

<details>
<summary>Inline HTML elements you can use</summary>
<p>Here's a pocket guide to some of the more interesting inline elements
you can use with links to the HTML standard. These all work well with Oatcake:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-em-element">The <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> element</a>
    is for stress emphasis.
    <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> is what <code>*single asterisks*</code> or <code>_single underscores_</code> do in Markdown.</p>

    <p>Not to be confused with <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-i-element"><code>&lt;i&gt;</code></a>
    which is for <q>a span of text in an alternate voice or mood, or otherwise
    offset from the normal prose in a manner indicating a different quality of
    text, such as a taxonomic designation, a technical term, an idiomatic
    phrase from another language, transliteration, a thought, or a ship name in
    Western texts.</q> A dream sequence is another example of
    <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> given in the HTML standard.</p>

    <p>Both are styled in italics:</p>

    <p><em>This is emphasised text with <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>.</em><br/>
    <i>This is text in an alternative voice or mood with <code>&lt;i&gt;</code>.</i>
    </p>

    <p>If some text is in an <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> because it's in a different language
    you can use the <code>lang</code> attribute to give the language:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;p&gt;There is a certain &lt;i lang="fr"&gt;je ne sais quoi&lt;/i&gt; in the air.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-strong-element">The <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> element</a>
    is for strong importance, seriousness or urgency.
    <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> is what <code>**double asterisks**</code> or <code>__double underscores__</code> do in Markdown.</p>

    <p>Not to be confused with <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-b-element"><code>&lt;b&gt;</code></a>
    which <q>represents a span of text to which attention is being drawn for
    utilitarian purposes without conveying any extra importance and with no
    implication of an alternate voice or mood, such as key words in a
    document abstract, product names in a review, actionable words in
    interactive text-driven software, or an article lede.</q></p>

    <p>Both are styled in bold:</p>

    <p><strong>This is important text with <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>.</strong><br/>
    <b>This is text to which attention is being drawn for utilitarian purposes with<code>&lt;b&gt;</code>.</b>
    </p>

    <p>You should use <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> only as a last resort when no other element is more appropriate.
    Use <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> for headings,
    <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> for stress emphasis,
    <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> for importance,
    and <code>&lt;mark&gt;</code> for highlighted or marked text.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p><a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-small-element">The <code>&lt;small&gt;</code> element</a>
    is for side comments and small print like disclaimers, caveats, legal
    restrictions or copyrights, attribution, etc.
    It's styled in small text: <small>this is some small text created with the <code>&lt;small&gt;</code> element</small>.
    </p>

    <p><code>&lt;small&gt;</code> is only for short runs of text,
    use <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/sections.html#the-aside-element"><code>&lt;aside&gt;</code></a>
    for larger sidebars, pull quotes, groups of <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> elements, etc.
    Use <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/sections.html#the-hgroup-element"><code>&lt;hgroup&gt;</code></a> for subheadings.
    </p>

  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-q-element">The <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> element</a>
      is for inline quotations: <q>Whatever you lose, you've won. Whatever you win, you've lost.</q>
    </p>

    <p>
      You don't have to type the quotation marks (&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;) yourself,
      just use <code>&lt;q&gt;&hellip;&lt;/q&gt;</code> and the browser will add the quotation marks for you.
    </p>

    <p>You can nest <code>&lt;q&gt;</code>'s to represent nested quotations:
    <q>The man said <q>Things that are impossible just take longer</q>. I disagreed with him.</q></p>

    <p><code>&lt;q&gt;</code> is only for quoting another source.
    If quotation marks are being used for another reason (for example to mark up sarcasm)
    you should just type the quotation marks yourself. The HTML standard gives this example
    of typing quotation marks directly when <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> would be inappropriate:</p>

    <blockquote>The word "ineffable" could have been used to describe the disaster
    resulting from the campaign's mismanagement.</blockquote>

    <p>For block quotations see the <a href="#blockquotes">section on blockquotes</a> below.</p>

    <p>You can add a <code>cite</code> attribute to a <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> to
    give the URL of the source being quoted for scripts to read,
    and you can use a <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-cite-element"><code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> element</a>
    before or after a <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> to mark up a citation for the quote.
    See the <a href="#blockquotes">section on blockquotes</a> below for more about <code>cite</code> and <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code>.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li><p><a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-abbr-element">The <code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code> element</a>
    is for abbreviations and acronyms. If you provide the expansion of the
    abbreviation as the value of a <code>title</code> attribute on an
    <code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code> then in some browsers the abbreviation will get a
    dotted underline and the expansion will be shown in a tooltip on mouseover.
    For example this: <code>&lt;abbr title="Hypertext Markup
    Language"&gt;HTML&lt;/abbr&gt;</code> renders like this:
    <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-code-element">The <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> element</a>
      is for inline code spans: fragments of code or strings, filenames,
      computer programs, etc. This is what <code>`backticks`</code> do in
      Markdown. See <a href="#code-blocks">code blocks</a> below for multi-line code blocks.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of <code>&lt;code&gt;</code>, you can also use
    <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-var-element"><code>&lt;var&gt;</code></a>
    for programming, mathematical and prose variables, constants, symbols,
    quantities, parameters and placeholders.
    Here's an example from the HTML standard:</p>

    <blockquote>If there are <var>n</var> pipes leading to the ice
    cream factory then I expect at <em>least</em> <var>n</var>
    flavors of ice cream to be available for purchase!</blockquote>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-samp-element"><code>&lt;samp&gt;</code> element</a>
    represents output from a program
    and <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-kbd-element"><code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code></a>
    represents user input.
    See the <a href="#kbd-and-samp">section on <code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;samp&gt;</code></a> below for more.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-sub-and-sup-elements"><code>&lt;sub&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;sup&gt;</code> elements</a>
    are for <sub>subscript</sub> and <sup>superscript</sup>.</p>

    <p>Superscripts can be used to create footnotes.<sup><a href="#footnote1" id="backref1">[1]</a></sup></p>

    <p>The HTML standard gives some interesting examples of <code>&lt;sub&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;sup&gt;</code> used
    with <code>&lt;var&gt;</code> for variables or mathematical expressions like
    <var>x<sub><var>i</var></sub></var> or <var>c</var><sup>2</sup>.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-u-element">The <code>&lt;u&gt;</code> element</a>
      gives a span of text an <q>unarticulated, though explicitly rendered,
      non-textual annotation, such as labeling the text as being a proper
      name in Chinese text (a Chinese proper name mark), or labeling the text
      as being misspelt.</q>
      It's styled with an underline:
      <u>this is text annotated with <code>&lt;u&gt;</code></u>.
    </p>

    <p>Like <code>&lt;b&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;u&gt;</code> is another last-resort element:
    use <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> for stress emphasis,
    <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;mark&gt;</code> to mark key words or phrases,
    <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> to mark book titles,
    <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> for technical terms, taxonomic designations, transliterations, or thoughts.
    <code>&lt;u&gt;</code>'s are also discouraged where users might confuse them with hyperlinks
    (<a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-a-element"><code>&lt;a&gt;</code></a>)
    which are conventionally rendered with an underline.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-mark-element">The <code>&lt;mark&gt;</code> element</a>
      is for denoting the <em>relevance</em> of a span of text to the current context
      (as opposed to denoting <em>importance</em>, which is done with <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>,
      or <em>emphasis</em>, which is done with <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>).
      <code>&lt;mark&gt;</code>'s are styled with a background highlight:
      <mark>this is some text marked as relevant using <code>&lt;mark&gt;</code></mark>.</p>

      <p>More specifically, a <code>&lt;mark&gt;</code> represents:
      <q>a run of text in one document marked or highlighted for reference purposes, due to its relevance in another context.</q>
      For example you can use a <code>&lt;mark&gt;</code> in a quotation to
      highlight text that wasn't highlighted in the original quote but
      is being highlighted now to bring attention to part of the quote.
      Other examples given in the HTML standard are highlighting search string
      matches and highlighting a bug in a code block (or more generally
      highlighting part of a code block that is referred to from elsewhere in
      the text).
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/edits.html#the-del-element">The <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> element</a>
    is for text that has been "removed" from the document like crossing-off the
    completed items on a todo list, whereas
    <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-s-element"><code>&lt;s&gt;</code></a>
    is for text that's no longer accurate or relevant.
    Both are styled with a strike-through:</p>

    <p>
    <del>This is text that's been struck through with <code>&ltdel&gt;</code> to remove it from the document.</del><br/>
    <s>This is text that's been struck through with <code>&lts&gt;</code> to mark it as no longer accurate or relevant.</s>
    </p>

    <p>The <code>cite</code> attribute can be added to a
    <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> to give the URL of a document that explains the
    change, and a <code>datetime</code> attribute can be used to give the date
    and time of the change.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p><a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/edits.html#the-ins-element">The <code>&lt;ins&gt;</code> element</a>
    is for text that has been added to the document. It's styled with an underline the same as <code>&lt;u&gt;</code>:
    <ins>this is text that has been marked as added to the document with <code>&lt;ins&gt;</code></ins>.</p>

    <p>As with
    <code>&lt;del&gt;</code>, you can add a <code>cite</code> attribute to an
    <code>&lt;ins&gt;</code> to give the URL of a document that explains the
    change, and a <code>datetime</code> attribute to give the date and time of
    the change.</p>

    <p>You can represent items added to or removed from a list by
    wrapping the contents of <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>'s in
    <code>&lt;ins&gt;</code>'s or <code>&lt;del&gt;</code>'s:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>First list item</li>
      <li><del>Removed list item</del></li>
      <li><ins>Added list item</ins></li>
      <li>Last list item</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

</ul>
</details>

<h2>Headings</h2>

<p>Headings are one of the hardest things to get right.
HTML provides six levels of headings, far more than most documents need.
Themes trying to make all six levels visually distinct results in distractions
like overlarge font sizes, excessively heavy weights, ALL CAPS, underlines,
centered text, too many font faces, too much indentation, etc.
Most themes make <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>'s too big for my taste (at least with
the types of titles I tend to write).</p>

<p>Most pages should use no more than three levels of headings anyway,
preferably two. More levels are confusing and make it difficult for readers to
use the headings to orient themselves within the document.</p>

<p>Oatcake focuses on providing three visually distinct levels of headings,
using the smallest necessary increments in font size and space above and below
to emphasise and distinguish headings without the design attracting too much
attention.</p>

<p>A common mistake is to vertically align headings closer to the paragraph
above than to the one below, or evenly mid-way between them. Oatcake gives
headings a little more vertical space above than below so they're visually
related more with the text below (that belongs to the heading) than to the
unrelated text above.</p>

<p>Here's a demo of Oatcake's headings:</p>

<div class="note">
  <h1 class="notoc noanchor">Page title (level 1 heading)</h1>

  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Integer
  malesuada, justo tincidunt mattis gravida, velit orci facilisis nibh, at
  hendrerit risus sem eu arcu.</p>

  <h2 class="notoc noanchor">Level 2 heading</h2>

  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Integer
  malesuada, justo tincidunt mattis gravida, velit orci facilisis nibh, at
  hendrerit risus sem eu arcu.</p>

  <h3 class="notoc noanchor">Level 3 heading</h3>

  <p>Suspendisse vitae bibendum libero. In in lorem lacus. Proin pharetra neque
  venenatis, fringilla justo id, elementum magna. Maecenas vestibulum tortor
  urna, vel pharetra nisi commodo vel.</p>

  <h4 class="notoc noanchor">Level 4 heading</h4>

  <p>Suspendisse dignissim tempor ultricies. Phasellus in sollicitudin felis,
  eget fringilla quam. Vestibulum suscipit arcu dapibus placerat cursus.
  Suspendisse dignissim orci in nibh convallis, sit amet tempus dui
  tincidunt.</p>

  <h5 class="notoc noanchor">Level 5 heading</h5>

  <p>Suspendisse dignissim tempor ultricies. Phasellus in sollicitudin felis,
  eget fringilla quam. Vestibulum suscipit arcu dapibus placerat cursus.</p>

  <h6 class="notoc noanchor">Level 6 heading</h6>

  <p>Suspendisse dignissim tempor ultricies.</p>
</div>

<p><code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>'s and <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>'s look the same
(other than a bit more vertical space above an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>). The
intention is that pages will start with a single <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> whose
position at the top of the page makes it clear that it's the top-level title,
and then <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>'s will be used for any mid-document headings.</p>

<p>If you need sub-headings and sub-sub-headings use <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>'s
and <code>&lt;h4&gt;</code>'s.

<p>You can also use <code>&lt;h5&gt;</code>'s and <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>'s but
they look the same as <code>&lt;h4&gt;</code>'s.</p>

<h3>Hierarchical headings</h3>

<p>It's better to use fewer levels of headings but if you really need several
levels I recommend making the structure explicit by hierarchically numbering
the headings as the HTML standard itself does with its own headings (you have
to do this yourself, Oatcake won't do it for you):</p>

<div class="note">
  <h1 class="notoc noanchor">Document title</h1>

  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Integer
  malesuada, justo tincidunt mattis gravida, velit orci facilisis nibh, at
  hendrerit risus sem eu arcu.</p>

  <h2 class="notoc noanchor">1. Second-level heading</h2>

  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Integer
  malesuada, justo tincidunt mattis gravida, velit orci facilisis nibh, at
  hendrerit risus sem eu arcu.</p>

  <h3 class="notoc noanchor">1.1 Third-level heading</h3>

  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Integer
  malesuada, justo tincidunt mattis gravida, velit orci facilisis nibh, at
  hendrerit risus sem eu arcu.</p>

  <h3 class="notoc noanchor">1.2 Another third-level heading</h3>

  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Integer
  malesuada, justo tincidunt mattis gravida, velit orci facilisis nibh, at
  hendrerit risus sem eu arcu.</p>

  <h4 class="notoc noanchor">1.2.1 Fourth-level heading</h4>

  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Integer
  malesuada, justo tincidunt mattis gravida, velit orci facilisis nibh, at
  hendrerit risus sem eu arcu.</p>

  <h4 class="notoc noanchor">1.2.2 Another fourth-level heading</h4>

  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Integer
  malesuada, justo tincidunt mattis gravida, velit orci facilisis nibh, at
  hendrerit risus sem eu arcu.</p>

  <h3 class="notoc noanchor">1.3 Another third-level heading</h3>

  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Integer
  malesuada, justo tincidunt mattis gravida, velit orci facilisis nibh, at
  hendrerit risus sem eu arcu.</p>

  <h2 class="notoc noanchor">2. Another second-level heading</h2>

  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Integer
  malesuada, justo tincidunt mattis gravida, velit orci facilisis nibh, at
  hendrerit risus sem eu arcu.</p>
</div>

<h3>Stacked headings</h3>

<p>Sometimes one immediately directly follows another heading, without any other
text between them.  A common mistake when this happens is for the extra
vertical space above and below headings to end up looking weird, creating large
unnecessary gaps between the headings.  Oatcake fixes this by styling headings
that immediately follow other headings with less vertical space than they would
have otherwise:</p>

<div class="note">
  <h1 class="notoc noanchor">First-level heading</h1>
  <h2 class="notoc noanchor">Second-level heading</h2>
  <h3 class="notoc noanchor">Third-level heading</h3>
  <h4 class="notoc noanchor">Fourth-level heading</h4>
  <h5 class="notoc noanchor">Fifth-level heading</h5>
  <h6 class="notoc noanchor">Sixth-level heading</h6>

<h3>Inline styles in headings</h3>

<p>A lot of themes break or look weird if you try to use emphasis, code, etc in
a heading.  Oatcake makes sure that common inline styles work in
headings:</p>

<div class="note">
  <h1 class="notoc noanchor">A heading with <em>italics</em> in it</h1>
  <h2 class="notoc noanchor">A heading with <code>code()</code> in it</h2>
  <h2 class="notoc noanchor">A heading with <samp>sample output</samp> in it</h2>
  <h2 class="notoc noanchor">A heading with a <kbd>kbd</kbd> in it</h2>
  <h2 class="notoc noanchor">A heading with <u>underlined text</u> in it</h2>
  <h2 class="notoc noanchor">A heading with <mark>highlighted text</mark> in it</h2>
  <h2 class="notoc noanchor">A heading with <del>deleted text</del> in it</h2>
  <h2 class="notoc noanchor">A heading with <a href="">a link</a> in it</h2>
  <h2 class="notoc noanchor">A heading with <a href=""><code>code link</code></a> in it</h2>
  <h2 class="notoc noanchor">A heading with mid-word em<em>phas</em>is in it</h2>
  <h3 class="notoc noanchor"><code>an_all_code_heading()</code></h3>
  <h1 class="notoc noanchor"><code>code()</code> at the start of a heading</h1>
  <h1 class="notoc noanchor">A heading with<sup>superscript</sup> and<sub>subscript</sub> and <small>small text</small> in it</h1>
</div>

<h3>Multi-line headings</h3>

<p>Sometimes a heading runs onto multiple lines, especially on small screens.
Many themes fail to account for this and the multiple lines of a heading either
have too much space between them or too little, often actually overlapping.
With Oatcake multi-line headings wrap well, this is a multi-line
<code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> heading:</p>

<div class="note">
  <h2 class="notoc noanchor">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore</h2>
</div>

<p>This is a multi-line <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> heading:</p>

<div class="note">
  <h3 class="notoc noanchor">Lorem ipsum dolgor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam</h3>
</div>

<p>This is a multi-line <code>&lt;h4&gt;</code> heading:</p>

<div class="note">
  <h4 class="notoc noanchor">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco</h4>
</div>

<p>Multi-line headings can even contain inline elements:</p>

<div class="note">
  <h2 class="notoc noanchor">
    This is a long multiline <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> heading
    containing <em>emphasis</em>,
    <code>&lt;code tags&gt;</code>,
    some <samp>sample output</samp>,
    a couple of code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code>'s: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<kbd>c</kbd>,
    <u>underlined text</u>,
    <mark>highlighted text</mark>,
    <del>struck-through text</del>,
    <a href="">a link</a>,
    <a href=""><code>a code link</code></a>
    and even<sup>superscript</sup> and<sub>subscript</sub> and <small>small text</small> in it</h1>

  </h2>

  <h3 class="notoc noanchor">
    This is a long multiline <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> heading
    containing <em>emphasis</em>,
    <code>&lt;code tags&gt;</code>,
    some <samp>sample output</samp>,
    a couple of <code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code>'s: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<kbd>c</kbd>,

    <del>struck-through text</del>,
    <a href="">a link</a>,
    <a href=""><code>a code link</code></a>
    and even<sup>superscript</sup> and<sub>subscript</sub> and <small>small text</small> in it</h1>
  </h3>

<h2>Lists</h2>

<p>Here's what a simple unordered list (<a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-ul-element"><code>&lt;ul&gt;</code></a>) looks like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Vivamus sit amet elit bibendum</li>
  <li>Aliquam ornare sapien ut nisl tristique</li>
  <li>Praesent aliquet erat eu felis</li>
</ul>

<p>And an ordered list (<a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-ol-element"><code>&lt;ol&gt;</code></a>):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Vivamus sit amet elit bibendum</li>
  <li>Aliquam ornare sapien ut nisl tristique</li>
  <li>Praesent aliquet erat eu felis</li>
</ol>

<details>
  <summary>Tips for HTML ordered lists</summary>

<p>Did you know that you can reverse the order of the numbers in a numbered
list by adding a <code>reversed</code> attribute to a
<code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>? (<code>&lt;ol reversed&gt;</code>)</p>

<ol reversed>
  <li>Vivamus sit amet elit bibendum</li>
  <li>Aliquam ornare sapien ut nisl tristique</li>
  <li>Praesent aliquet erat eu felis</li>
</ol>

<p>Or you can change the list starting number by adding a <code>start="n"</code> attribute:</p>

<ol start="4">
  <li>Vivamus sit amet elit bibendum</li>
  <li>Aliquam ornare sapien ut nisl tristique</li>
  <li>Praesent aliquet erat eu felis</li>
</ol>

<p><code>reversed</code> and <code>start</code> can be used together on the same list:</p>

<ol reversed start="10">
  <li>Vivamus sit amet elit bibendum</li>
  <li>Aliquam ornare sapien ut nisl tristique</li>
  <li>Praesent aliquet erat eu felis</li>
</ol>

<p>You can change the type of list markers using the <code>type</code> attribute:
<code>type="1"</code> for numbers (the default),
<code>type="a"</code> for lower-case letters,
<code>type="A"</code> for upper-case letters,
<code>type="i"</code> for lower-case roman numerals,
or <code>type="I"</code> for upper-case roman numerals:</p>

<ol type="a">
  <li>Vivamus sit amet elit bibendum</li>
  <li>Aliquam ornare sapien ut nisl tristique</li>
  <li>Praesent aliquet erat eu felis</li>
</ol>

<ol type="A">
  <li>Vivamus sit amet elit bibendum</li>
  <li>Aliquam ornare sapien ut nisl tristique</li>
  <li>Praesent aliquet erat eu felis</li>
</ol>

<ol type="i">
  <li>Vivamus sit amet elit bibendum</li>
  <li>Aliquam ornare sapien ut nisl tristique</li>
  <li>Praesent aliquet erat eu felis</li>
</ol>

<ol type="I">
  <li>Vivamus sit amet elit bibendum</li>
  <li>Aliquam ornare sapien ut nisl tristique</li>
  <li>Praesent aliquet erat eu felis</li>
</ol>
</details>

<h3>Nested lists</h3>

<p>Themes often mess up nested lists: erasing the nested structure by
collapsing the indentation, putting incorrect vertical space before or after a
nested list, or otherwise making it look bad.  Oatcake doesn't mess it up and
allows indentation to show the nested structure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Vivamus non arcu quis sem aliquam</li>
  <li>Quisque in quam tempor, finibus odio nec</li>
  <li>Aenean lacinia augue vel orci efficitur</li>
  <li>Mauris nec sem dapibus, convallis dolor eu
    <ol>
      <li>Ut quis neque ac lectus vestibulum</li>
      <li>Fusce congue tortor blandit elit</li>
      <li>Suspendisse porttitor justo at massa
        <ul>
          <li>Vestibulum a turpis non urna</li>
          <li>Integer non orci a ex aliquam</li>
          <li>Nullam sit amet turpis sit amet</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Cras nec nulla tincidunt</li>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Vivamus ullamcorper orci a leo pretium</li>
  <li>Maecenas volutpat est eget purus placerat</li>
</ul>

<h3>Multi-line list items</h3>

<p>Some or all of the items in a list can wrap over multiple lines and it'll
look fine:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Vivamus sit amet elit bibendum.</li>
  <li>Morbi tempor sit amet mi nec auctor. Nulla metus purus, pulvinar sed eros
  non, ornare hendrerit lacus. Nullam rhoncus pretium turpis iaculis
  sollicitudin. Mauris ligula velit, ullamcorper a luctus sed, gravida vitae
  leo.</li>
  <li>Praesent aliquet erat eu felis.</li>
  <li>Duis finibus commodo velit, ac aliquam nibh interdum vitae. Sed luctus vel
  dolor vel fringilla. Cras bibendum, turpis nec vestibulum vestibulum, augue
  sem ultricies urna, eu condimentum libero sapien eget nisi.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Paragraph list items</h3>

<p>If you leave blank lines between a list's items Markdown renders them as
<code>&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;</code>'s rather than just <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>'s,
which results in the list being rendered with some vertical space between
items. Here's what a list of <code>&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;</code>'s looks like with Oatcake:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Vivamus sit amet elit bibendum, sollicitudin turpis vel, ullamcorper purus.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Morbi tempor sit amet mi nec auctor. Nulla metus purus, pulvinar sed eros
    non, ornare hendrerit lacus. Nullam rhoncus pretium turpis iaculis
    sollicitudin. Mauris ligula velit, ullamcorper a luctus sed, gravida vitae
    leo.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Praesent aliquet erat eu felis malesuada maximus.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Duis finibus commodo velit, ac aliquam nibh interdum vitae. Sed luctus vel
    dolor vel fringilla. Cras bibendum, turpis nec vestibulum vestibulum, augue
    sem ultricies urna, eu condimentum libero sapien eget nisi.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Nested lists also work inside paragraph lists:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Here's a nested list inside a paragraph list item:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>First list item</li>
      <li>Second list item</li>
      <li>Third list item</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Praesent aliquet erat eu felis malesuada maximus.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A nested paragraph list inside a paragraph list item:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>First list item</p></li>
      <li><p>Second list item</p></li>
      <li><p>Third list item</p></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Phasellus congue tortor sed elementum placerat.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Other block elements inside lists</h3>

<p>Other block elements like blockquotes, code blocks etc inside lists are
another common source of breakage that works fine with Oatcake.:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A list item with a blockquote:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>This is a blockquote inside a list item.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A list item with a code block:</p>

    <pre><code class="nohighlight">&lt;code goes here&gt;</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A list item with a definition list in it:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Term</dt>
      <dd>Description</dd>
      <dt>Term</dt>
      <dd>Description</dd>
    </dl>
  <li>A normal list item to end the list.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Images inside lists</h4>

<p>Even images work in list items, either on their own or sharing the list item
with paragraphs before or after the image:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <img src="/images/bird.jpg"  alt="A photo of a bird" title="A photo of a bird" />
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This image of a fox is the second and last block item in this list item:</p>
    <img src="/images/fox.jpg"  alt="A photo of a fox" title="A photo of a fox" />
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This image of an elephant is the second of three block items in this list item:</p>
    <img src="/images/elephant.jpg"  alt="A photo of an elephant" title="A photo of an elephant" />
    <p>This paragraph is still part of the same list item.</p>
  </li>
</ul>


<h2>Definition lists</h2>

<p><a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-dl-element">The <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code> (definition list) element</a>
represents:</p>

<blockquote>&hellip;an association list consisting of zero or more name-value groups (a description list)</blockquote>

<p>This could be a list of <q>&hellip;terms and definitions, metadata topics and values, questions and answers, or any other groups of name-value data.</q></p>

<p>Within a <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code> you use pairs of <code>&lt;dt&gt;</code>'s
for the names ("terms") and <code>&lt;dd&gt;</code>'s for the values
("descriptions" or "definitions").
You can have multiple <code>&lt;dt&gt;</code>'s in a row if an item has more than one name
and/or multiple <code>&lt;dd&gt;</code>'s in a row if an item has more than one value.
Here's some examples from the HTML standard:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;dl&gt;
 &lt;dt&gt; Authors
 &lt;dd&gt; John
 &lt;dd&gt; Luke
 &lt;dt&gt; Editor
 &lt;dd&gt; Frank
&lt;/dl&gt;</code></pre>

<pre><code>&lt;dl&gt;
 &lt;dt lang="en-US"&gt;&lt;dfn&gt;color&lt;/dfn&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
 &lt;dt lang="en-GB"&gt;&lt;dfn&gt;colour&lt;/dfn&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
 &lt;dd&gt;A sensation which (in humans) derives from the ability of
 the fine structure of the eye to distinguish three differently
 filtered analyses of a view.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;</code></pre>

<p>Notice the use of the <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-dfn-element"><code>&lt;dfn&gt;</code> element</a>
to mark up the terms when a definition list is being used to define terms.
Oatcake doesn't style <code>&lt;dfn&gt;</code>'s but they have semantic meaning.</p>

<p>Here's what definition lists look like with Oatcake:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Oatcake</dt>
  <dd>Thin flat unleavened cake of baked oatmeal.</dd>
  <dt>Oatmeal</dt>
  <dd>Porridge made of rolled oats.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Here's how items look with multiple terms, multiple descriptions, and both:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Unleavened</dt>
  <dt>Unraised</dt>
  <dd>Made without leavening. Unleavened bread is often simple flour mixed with water.</dd>

  <dt>Sow one's wild oats</dt>
  <dd>Live promiscuously and self-indulgently.</dd>
  <dd>To have a period of youthful exuberance; to act wildly, especially before marriage.</dd>

  <dt>Wild oat</dt>
  <dt>Avena fatua</dt>
  <dd>Common in meadows and pastures.</dd>
  <dd>Synonyms: wild oat grass.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The contents of a single <code>&lt;dd&gt;</code> can be wrapped in a
<code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and a single <code>&lt;dd&gt;</code> can contain
multiple <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>'s if it's a multi-paragraph description.
Oatcake handles <code>&lt;dd&gt;</code>'s containing one or more
<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>'s just fine and styles them the same as
<code>&lt;dd&gt;</code>'s without <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>'s:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Pancake</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A flat cake of thin batter fried on both sides on a griddle.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Pancake turtle</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Voracious aquatic turtle with a flat flexible shell covered by a leathery skin; can inflict painful bites.</p>
    <p>Synonym: soft-shelled turtle.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Tortoise</dt>
  <dt>Tortoises</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Usually herbivorous land turtles having clawed elephant-like limbs.</p>
  </dd>
  <dd>
    <p>Etymology: Old English <i>tortuce</i>, from Old French <i>tortis</i> crooked, from
    Latin <i>tortus</i> twisted, crooked, contorted, past participle of
    <i>torquere</i>, <i>tortum</i>, to wind.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>


<h2 id="blockquotes">Blockquotes</h2>

<p>You can use <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-q-element"><code>&lt;q&gt;</code></a>
for inline quotes. For multi-line or block quotes use <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-blockquote-element"><code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code></a>,
which looks like this:</p>

<blockquote>Ut fermentum turpis quis ligula sagittis, a fringilla orci
ultrices. Nam fringilla erat ac bibendum tristique. Morbi nec maximus augue.
Donec in justo semper, convallis ante et, laoreet nibh.</blockquote>

<p>You can optionally wrap the contents of a <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> in
a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, it looks the same:</p>

<blockquote></p>Maecenas eu purus in nibh pharetra gravida. Nullam consequat
fringilla velit, nec maximus ex luctus quis. Maecenas tempor sollicitudin nisl
ac consequat.  Nullam ut iaculis tortor.</p></blockquote>

<details>
  <summary>Blockquote usage tips</summary>

  <p>You shouldn't put quotation marks (&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;) around the text
  inside a blockquote: putting the text in a <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> is
  enough to show that it's a quotation, and the quotation marks aren't part of
  the quote itself. You don't put quotation marks inside an inline
  <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> either, just wrap the text in a <code>&lt;q&gt;</code>
  and the browser will add the quotation marks for you.</p>

  <p>In English it's traditional to use square brackets if abbreviating or
  adding context to a block or inline quote, as in this example from the HTML
  standard (which also handily demonstrates that one-liner
  <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code>'s also work):</p>

  <blockquote><p>[Jane] then said she liked [...] fish.</p></blockquote>

  <p>You can use <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-mark-element"><code>&lt;mark&gt;</code>'s</a>
  inside quotes to highlight something that wasn't highlighted in the original
  quote:</p>

  <blockquote>
  Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has
  roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it
  <mark>over 2000 years old</mark>. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
  Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin
  words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the
  word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. <mark>Lorem Ipsum
  comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"
  (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.</mark>
  </blockquote>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Attributions and citations</summary>

<p>A <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> represents text
that is quoted from another source. You can add a <code>cite</code> attribute
whose value is a URL for the source:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;blockquote cite="https://quotes.example.org/s/sonnet130.html"&gt;</code></pre>

<p><code>cite</code> attributes aren't visible in the rendered HTML,
they're meant to be read by scripts.</p>

<p>Any attribution for the quotation is supposed to go before or after the
<code>&lt;q&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code>, not inside it,
because the attribution isn't part of the quote itself. For example the
attribution could go in a following <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, as in this example
from the HTML standard:</p>

<blockquote>
 <p>I contend that we are both atheists. I just believe in one fewer
 god than you do. When you understand why you dismiss all the other
 possible gods, you will understand why I dismiss yours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Stephen Roberts</p>

<p>If the attribution contains the title of a work you can wrap it in a
<a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-cite-element"><code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> element</a>,
as in this example also from the HTML standard:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;His next piece was the aptly named &lt;cite&gt;Sonnet 130&lt;/cite&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun,&lt;br&gt;
  Coral is far more red, than her lips red,&lt;br&gt;
  ...</code></pre>

<p><code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> elements aren't styled any differently from normal
text, they're semantic markup only.</p>

<p>Only the title of the work should go inside the <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code>,
not an entire phrase or sentence.</p>

<p>You shouldn't wrap an author's name in a <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> because
it's not the title of a work.</p>

<p><code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> can be used whenever you're mentioning the title
of a work and want to mark it up semantically, even if you're not quoting from
the work.</p>

<p>You can put a <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> in a
<code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> and the attribution in the
<code>&lt;figure&gt;</code>'s <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code>,
see <a href="#figures">the section on figures</a> below for an example.</p>
</details>

<h3>Block elements inside blockquotes</h3>

<p>Blockquotes can contain other block-level elements: multiple paragraphs,
lists, code blocks, and even images:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Aliquam a faucibus dui. Donec a diam a odio dapibus varius. Nulla sagittis
  in lacus in dictum. Aliquam eu purus non risus facilisis dapibus.</p>

  <p>Praesent porttitor cursus diam, at porta massa suscipit nec. Duis eu leo
  ut justo vestibulum pellentesque eget quis magna.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>First list item</li>
    <li>Second list item</li>
  </ul>

  <img src="images/buffalo.jpg" alt="A photo of a buffalo" title="A photo of a buffalo" />

  <pre><code>code block
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>Nested blockquotes</h3>

<p>You can nest <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code>'s to an arbitrary depth and
Oatcake will show the nested structure. A lot of themes get this wrong:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fusce porta quam non varius viverra.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Vestibulum molestie nec massa et porta.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Donec imperdiet pretium luctus.</p>

      <p>Etiam in malesuada lacus. Suspendisse eget velit lacinia, hendrerit
      lorem nec, pretium urna.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Morbi tempor luctus sodales. Vitae vehicula lorem gravida nec.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Nam commodo felis at tortor tempor, sit amet vestibulum lorem gravida.
  Suspendisse dignissim felis velit.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Headings in blockquotes</h3>

<p>Sometimes a quoted section contains a heading. A lot of themes get this
wrong, especially if the heading starts the blockquote, often by introducing a
weirdly large vertical space at the top of the blockquote. Oatcake styles
headings that begin blockquotes with less preceding vertical space than the
heading would normally have:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2 class="notoc noanchor">An <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> at the start of a <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code></h2>

  <p>Pellentesque sit amet leo nec tortor condimentum vestibulum quis ut
  sapien. Nulla a volutpat orci. Phasellus ac odio commodo, commodo erat ac,
  porta turpis.</p>

  <h3 class="notoc noanchor">An <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> within a <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code></h3>

  <p>Quisque auctor gravida massa sed tincidunt. Phasellus mollis turpis ac
  nisi mollis, vel laoreet turpis malesuada. Suspendisse vehicula mollis
  mauris, eu eleifend massa egestas varius.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <h3 class="notoc noanchor">An <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> at the start of a <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code></h3>

  <p>This is the body of the blockquote</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <h4 class="notoc noanchor">An <code>&lt;h4&gt;</code> at the start of a <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code></h4>

  <p>This is the body of the blockquote</p>
</blockquote>


<h2>Images</h2>

<p>Images need a little more space above and below them than paragraphs do,
otherwise they feel cramped. Oatcake gives images just enough space&ndash;not too
much, not too little, and sticking to the vertical rhythm. This works the same
whether or not you wrap your <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>'s in
<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>'s:</p>

<img src="images/sand.jpg" alt="A photo of some sand" title="A photo of some sand" />

<p>An image's height can upset the vertical rhythm unless you make sure your
it's an even multiple of the line height, and browsers resizing images to fit
the display width can complicate things. This page contains a snippet of
JavaScript that fixes the sizes of images to the vertical rhythm.  But I
recommend not worrying about it.</p>


<h2 id="code-blocks">Preformatted text and code blocks</h2>

<p>Preformatted text blocks
(created with the <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-pre-element"><code>&lt;pre&gt;</code></a> element)
look like this in Oatcake:</p>

<pre><h4 class="notoc noanchor">Useful emptiness</h4>
Heaven and earth aren't humane.

To them the thousand things
are straw dogs.

Wise souls aren't humane.
To them the thousand families
are straw dogs.

Heaven and earth
act as a bellows:

Empty yet structured,
it moves, inexhaustibly giving.</pre>

<p><em>Code</em> blocks can created with <code>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;</code> tags.
This is what indenting a block of text by four spaces or one tab does in Markdown
(or "fenced code blocks" with <code>```</code> in many versions of Markdown).
Oatcake gives code blocks a monospaced font:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
    printf("Hello World!\n");
}</code></pre>

<p>Oatcake also supports <code>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;samp&gt;</code> blocks. These
have a different semantic meaning in HTML: they represent a block of computer
<em>output</em>.  Oatcake styles <code>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;samp&gt;</code> the same
as <code>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;</code>:</p>

<pre><samp>$ gcc -g -o helloworld -ansi helloworld.c
$ gdb helloworld
(gdb) run
Hello World
(gdb) quit</samp></pre>

<p>You can use inline elements in preformatted, code and sample output blocks:
bold, italics, underline, strikethrough, small text. Here's one with a
bunch:</p>

<pre><code><em>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</em>

int <u>main()</u>
{
    /* Here's a code comment with<sub>subscript</sub> and.<sup>superscript</sup> */
    /* <small>Here's a code comment in small text.</small> */
    /* Here's an <q>inline quote</q> in a code block. */
    <strong>printf</strong>(<del>"Hello World!\n"</del>);
}</code></pre>

<p>A useful application of inline elements in code blocks, from the HTML
standard, is using <code>&lt;mark&gt;</code> to highlight part of the code,
perhaps a part that is referred to from elsewhere in the text. For example
here's a code block with a bug highlighted:</p>

<pre><code>def whats_on_the_telly(<mark>penguin=[]</mark>):
    penguin.append("property of the zoo")
    return penguin</code></pre>

<p>A common bug in themes is for long lines in code blocks to stretch out
the width of the entire page which looks weird and breaks the layout on mobile
screens. Oatcake fixes this by giving wide code blocks a horizontal
scrollbar:</p>

<pre><code class="nohighlight">def test_validate_url_returns_an_http_url_unmodified():
    assert validate_url('http://github.com/jimsmith') == 'http://github.com/jimsmith'
</code></pre>

<h2 id="kbd-and-samp">Input and output with <code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;samp&gt;</code></h2>

<p>Oatcake supports user input with <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-kbd-element">the <code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code> element</a>
and sample output with <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-samp-element">the <code>&lt;samp&gt;</code> element</a>.</p>

<p>To represent user input from a keyboard or any other text entry device wrap
it in <code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code> tags: <kbd>help mycommand</kbd></p>

<p>You can use nested <code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code>'s to represent multiple keystrokes that form a
single input: <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd></kbd>.
Although you might prefer to write it without nesting like this:
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<kbd>c</kbd>.</p>

<p>Up to two levels of nesting are supported:
<kbd><kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>b</kbd></kbd> <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>t</kbd></kbd></kbd>.</p>

<p>To represent sample or quoted output from a computer program, wrap it in
<code>&lt;samp&gt;</code> tags: <samp>Keyboard not found. Press F1 to continue</samp></p>

<div class="note">
  <h3 class="notoc noanchor">Tip: use non-breaking spaces between <code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code>'s</h3>

  <p>Oatcake prevents browsers from wrapping a <code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code> (nested
  or single) over multiple lines even if the <code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code> contains
  multiple words separated by spaces, but if you're using a chain of separate
  <code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code>'s (as in
  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<kbd>c</kbd>) you must use non-breaking spaces
  (<code>&amp;nbsp;</code>) instead of normal spaces around the <code>+</code>
  if you want to prevent line breaks from being inserted in-between the
  <code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code>'s. Wrapping the whole sequence of
  <code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code>'s in a <code>&lt;span style="white-space: nowrap;"&gt;</code>
  should also work.</p>

  <p>You can also use either technique if you don't want a
  <code>&lt;code&gt;</code>,
  <code>&lt;samp&gt;</code>,
  <code>&lt;mark&gt;</code>,
  etc to be wrapped (Oatcake doesn't prevent wrapping within these elements by
  default because often you do what them to wrap, especially if they contain
  long strings that might otherwise
  <a href="#overflow">overflow the container</a>).</p>
</div>


<h2>Horizontal rules</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-hr-element"><code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> element</a>
is used for "thematic breaks" like a change of scene or topic. Here's what
<code>&lt;hr&gt;</code>'s look like with Oatcake:</p>

<hr />

<h2>Disclosure widgets: <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code></h2>

<p>You can create a disclosure widget with the <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interactive-elements.html#the-details-element"><code>&lt;details&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> elements</a>:

<details>
  <summary>This is the summary</summary>
  <p>And here are the details:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Cash on hand: $500.00</li>
    <li>Current invoice: $75.30</li>
    <li>Due date: 5/6/19</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<p>Adding the <code>open</code> attribute to a <code>&lt;details&gt;</code>
makes it already be open when the page loads:</p>

<details open>
  <summary>This is the summary</summary>
  <p>And here are the details:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Cash on hand: $500.00</li>
    <li>Current invoice: $75.30</li>
    <li>Due date: 5/6/19</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<p>You can nest disclosure widgets:</p>

<details>
  <summary>Outer widget</summary>
  <p>Details&hellip;</p>
  <details>
    <summary>Inner widget</summary>
    <p>Details&hellip;</p>
  </details>
</details>

<h3>Headings in disclosure widgets</h2>

<p>Oatcake makes sure that headings don't have too much vertical space before
them when they're used to start the hidden contents of a disclosure widget:</p>

<details>
  <summary>A <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> starting with an <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code></summary>
  <h2 class="notoc noanchor"><code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> heading</h2>
  <p>Here are the details&hellip;</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>A <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> starting with an <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code></summary>
  <h3 class="notoc noanchor"><code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> heading</h3>
  <p>Here are the details&hellip;</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>A <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> starting with an <code>&lt;h4&gt;</code></summary>
  <h4 class="notoc noanchor"><code>&lt;h4&gt;</code> heading</h4>
  <p>Here are the details&hellip;</p>
</details>

<h2 id="figures">Figures</h2>

<p>Oatcake has support for the <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> element. For example
you can put an image inside a figure like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/cow.jpg" alt="A photo of a cow."&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;</code></pre>

<p>To include a caption with your figure use the <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code>
tag:</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/cow.jpg" alt="A photo of a cow."&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A photo of a cow.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;</code></pre>

<p>That'll produce this output:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="images/cow.jpg" alt="A photo of a cow.">
  <figcaption>A photo of a cow.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Figures aren’t just for images. You can put anything in a figure. For example
here’s a code figure:</p>

<figure>
<pre><code class="language-ruby"># Public: Fetch the logger instance for this Jekyll process.
#
# Returns the LogAdapter instance.
def logger
  @logger ||= LogAdapter.new(Stevenson.new, (ENV["JEKYLL_LOG_LEVEL"] || :info).to_sym)
end</code></pre>
<figcaption>A method from the Jekyll source code.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Here's an example from the HTML standard with a
<code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> in a <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> and the
quote's attribution in the <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code>:</p>

<figure>
 <blockquote>
  <p>The truth may be puzzling. It may take some work to grapple with.
  It may be counterintuitive. It may contradict deeply held
  prejudices. It may not be consonant with what we desperately want to
  be true. But our preferences do not determine what's true. We have a
  method, and that method helps us to reach not absolute truth, only
  asymptotic approaches to the truth — never there, just closer
  and closer, always finding vast new oceans of undiscovered
  possibilities. Cleverly designed experiments are the key.</p>
 </blockquote>
 <figcaption>Carl Sagan, in "<cite>Wonder and Skepticism</cite>"</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Multi-line captions work fine, as do inline styles within captions:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="images/houses.jpg" alt="A photo of some houses.">
  <figcaption>
    <strong>Laboris</strong> nisi ut aliquip ex ea
commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate
velit <code>esse cillum dolore</code> eu fugiat nulla pariatur. <a href="https://example.com">Excepteur sint
occaecat</a> cupidatat non proident, <em>sunt in culpa</em> qui
officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<h3>When to use figures</h3>

<p>According to <a href="http://w3c.github.io/html-reference/figure.html">the HTML spec on <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code></a>
a figure is supposed to be a unit of content that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&hellip;is self-contained, that is typically referenced as a single
  unit from the main flow of the document, and that can be moved away from the
  main flow of the document without affecting the document's meaning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the location of an image or other content within the document
is important to the meaning of the document then you should just use a standard
<code>&lt;img&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;</code>, or other
content instead of a figure.</p>

<h2 id="overflow">Preventing really long words from overflowing</h2>

<p>Long unbroken words or other strings (such as URLs) that are too long to fit
on one line (even with a whole line to themselves) can overflow their
containers, especially on mobile, causing unwanted horizontal scrollbars or
other layout breakage. Oatcake fixes this by wrapping long words over multiple
lines if necessary to prevent overflow.</p>

<p>For example this really long Sanskrit word will get wrapped:
िरन्तरान्धकारित-दिगन्तर-कन्दलदमन्द-सुधारस-बिन्दु-सान्द्रतर-घनाघन-वृन्द-सन्देहकर-स्यन्दमान-मकरन्द-बिन्दु-बन्धुरतर-माकन्द-तरु-कुल-तल्प-कल्प-मृदुल-सिकता-जाल-जटिल-मूल-तल-मरुवक-मिलदलघु-लघु-लय-कलित-रमणीय-पानीय-शालिका-बालिका-करार-विन्द-गलन्तिका-गलदेला-लवङ्ग-पाटल-घनसार-कस्तूरिकातिसौरभ-मेदुर-लघुतर-मधुर-शीतलतर-सलिलधारा-निराकरिष्णु-तदीय-विमल-विलोचन-मयूख-रेखापसारित-पिपासायास-पथिक-लोकान्.
</p>

<p>So will this really long URL in a <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tag: <code>https://github.com/seanh/oatcake/commit/8675ffcb168b1d76d708c84a2821c20a3f99e86d</code>.</p>

<p>Oatcake <em>doesn't</em> wrap long words inside preformatted text
(<code>&lt;pre&gt;</code>) blocks -- you don't want your code being wrapped for
you, these use a horizontal scrollbar instead:

<pre><code>url = 'https://github.com/seanh/oatcake/commit/8675ffcb168b1d76d708c84a2821c20a3f99e86d'</code></pre>

<div class="note">
  <h4 class="notoc noanchor">Tip: avoid long text in a <code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;badge&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;pill&gt;</code></h4>

  <p>Oatcake's CSS prevents line-wrapping within a <code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code>,
  <code>&lt;badge&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;pill&gt;</code> (even if there are
  spaces) so don't make these too long or they'll overflow their container and
  break the layout.</p>
</div>

<h2>Embedding media from other sites</h2>

<p>Embedded media from other sites (YouTube videos, Google Slides
presentations, and the like) should work nicely and get harmonious top and
bottom margins, but without resorting to desperate measures it's difficult to
prevent these sorts of things from breaking the vertical rhythm, overflowing
containers, and triggering horizontal scrollbars on mobile devices.
Here's an <a href="media">example page with various embedded media</a>.</p>

<h2>CSS classes</h2>

<h3>Subtitles and lead paragraphs</h3>

<p>"Lead" paragraphs use a larger text style but not quite as large or bold as
headings.  To create a lead paragraph just add <code>class="lead"</code> to a
<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>.  For example this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p class="lead"&gt;
  This is a "lead" paragraph. It stands out more than other paragraphs. These
  can be used anywhere in a document.
&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>

<p>will render like this:</p>

<p class="lead">
  This is a "lead" paragraph. It stands out more than other paragraphs. These
  can be used anywhere in a document.
</p>

<p>You can use a lead paragraph as a subtitle by putting it together with a
heading in an <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/sections.html#the-hgroup-element"><code>&lt;hgroup&gt;</code></a>. This:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;hgroup&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;This is the heading&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p class="lead"&gt;This is the subtitle, it appears in large text beneath the heading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/hgroup&gt;</code></pre>

<p>will render like this:</p>

<hgroup>
  <h1 class="notoc noanchor">This is the heading</h1>
  <p class="lead">This is the subtitle, it appears in large text beneath the heading.</p>
</hgroup>

<p>Inline elements like <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;samp&gt;</code>
also work in subtitles and lead paragraphs:</p>

<p class="lead">
  This is a <code>&lt;lead&gt;</code> paragraph
  containing <em>emphasis</em>,
  <code>&lt;code tags&gt;</code>,
  some <samp>sample output</samp>,
  a couple of <code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code>'s: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<kbd>c</kbd>,
  <u>underlined text</u>,
  <mark>highlighted text</mark>,
  <del>struck-through text</del>,
  <a href="">a link</a>,
  <a href=""><code>a code link</code></a>.
  and even<sup>superscript</sup> and<sub>subscript</sub> and <small>small text</small> in it</h1>
</p>

<h3>Note boxes</h3>

<p>You can create a "note" by adding the CSS class <code>note</code> to a paragraph:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p class="note"&gt;This is a paragraph that stands out as a note.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>

<p>It'll look like this:</p>

<p class="note">This is a paragraph that stands out as a note.</p>

<p>A multi-line paragraph note will also work nicely:</p>

<p class="note">Morbi sed facilisis nunc. Quisque dictum lectus vitae purus
lobortis, dapibus malesuada sapien imperdiet. Vestibulum ante ipsum primis in
faucibus orci luctus et ultrices posuere cubilia curae.</p>

<p>You can also put the <code>note</code> class directly on an <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>
or <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> to style a list as a note:

<ul class="note">
  <li>Aenean</li>
  <li>Quis</li>
  <li>Odio</li>
  <li>Libero</li>
</ul>

<p>You can put multiple paragraphs and other arbitrary content (headings,
blockquotes, lists, code blocks, images&hellip;) in a note by putting the
<code>note</code> class on a containing <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>:</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>This note contains a list in a blockquote:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Duis efficitur justo semper mauris tempor:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Eget hendrerit diam</li>
      <li>Nunc feugiat congue dictum, <a href="">nullam auctor</a> in dui</li>
      <li><strong>a tempus nunc elementum</strong></li>
      <li>Pellentesque velit felis <code>bibendum</code> ac <kbd>quis</kbd> euismod</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>

  <h3>A heading</h3>

  <p>An image of a buffalo:</p>

  <img src="images/buffalo.jpg" alt="A photo of a buffalo" title="A photo of a buffalo" />

  <p>And an <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> followed by a code block:</p>

  <hr />

  <pre><code>You can even put code blocks in notes.</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Even disclosure widgets work inside note boxes:</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>Here's a <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> element inside a note box:</p>

  <details>
    <summary>This is the summary</summary>
    <p>Here are the details...</p>
  </details>
</div>

<p><a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/sections.html#the-aside-element"><code>&lt;aside class="note"&gt;</code></a>
would also work with the <code>note</code> class instead of a
<code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and has semantic meaning: it's for content that is
separate from the main content of the page and not part of the main flow of the
document.</p>

<p>It would be easy to provide a variety of different colours for note boxes
like other frameworks do. But documents with lots of different-coloured boxes
would distract from both reading and writing (always having to choose which
type of box to use) and would make it difficult to add support for dark mode
and for different colour schemes.</p>

<h4>Headings in note boxes</h4>

<p>Note boxes can also have opening headings without too much vertical space:</p>

<div class="note">
  <h2 class="notoc noanchor">An <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> in a note</h2>
  <p>This is the body of the note.</p>
</div>

<div class="note">
  <h3 class="notoc noanchor">An <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> in a note</h3>
  <p>This is the body of the note.</p>
</div>

<div class="note">
  <h4 class="notoc noanchor">An <code>&lt;h4&gt;</code> in a note</h4>
  <p>This is the body of the note</p>
</div>


<h3>Badges and pills</h3>

<p>Oatcake provides badges and pills that you can use for tags and other UI
elements, just create a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> with the CSS class
<code>badge</code> or <code>pill</code>:</p>

<p><span class="badge">Badge</span> <span class="pill">Pill</span></p>

<p>You can also put the <code>badge</code> or <code>pill</code> class on an
<code>&lt;a&gt;</code> or <code>&ltbutton&gt;</code> to create a badge or pill
with hover and focus states:</p>

<p>
  <a href="" class="badge">An <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> badge</a>
  <a href="" class="pill">An <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> pill</a>
  <button class="badge">A <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> badge</button>
  <button class="pill">A <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> pill</button>
</p>

<p>Badges and pills can be used inside paragraphs (or list items, headings etc):</p>

<h3 class="notoc noanchor" style="padding-top: 0;">Heading <span class="pill">Pill</span></h3>

<p>This is a paragraph with an inline <span class="badge">badge</span> in
it. As with <code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code>'s, if your badge or pill contains
<span class="pill">more than one word</span> Oatcake prevents browsers from
wrapping it over multiple lines.</p>

<ul>
  <li>First list item <span class="badge">23</span></li>
  <li>Second list item <span class="pill">16</span></li>
  <li>Third list item <span class="badge">32</span></li>
</ul>

<p>As with note boxes, it was tempting to add a variety of different colour
choices for badges and pills but this would be distracting and would make it
harder to add dark mode and multiple colour schemes.</p>
